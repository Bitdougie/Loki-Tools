 Welcome to Loki Tools, right now this project is still under construction
 but with hope and time we hope to have something of some use to people.
 
 Right now this is getting developed for OSX but there will be a version
 for windows and linux that will be released once this proof of concept works.
 
 ***************
 The following problems are the aims of this project to solve
 ***************
 
 ** The problem **
 
 ** PROBLEM 1
 In tool/spare parts retail stores the potential supplible items and the items kept
 in stock are vastly different, a store maybe holding 20,000 different
 types of items in stock and some 1.2 million items suppliable from 200+
 suppliers which 20 will be your core suppliers for most items. To allow
 quick finding and pricing of items a searchable library of all suppliers
 is required. (right now I have 200+ price books which are out of date and
 have no rational index PLEASE HELP ME!!! :-P)
 
 ** PROBLEM 2
 Promotions for tool/spare parts stores often have some 200-400 items and run for 1-3 months
 this process needs to be automated in setup in the stores accounting
 system to minisise costs and new items must be added to the accounting
 system when a new item goes on promotion.
 
 ** PROBLEM 3
 Stock pricing for tool/spare parts stores is important as spare parts can sit in stock
 for months/years before being required so to regular price updates are
 needed to keep pace with material,frieght and inflation.
 
 ** PROBLEM 4
 Stock levels for tool/spare parts stores is difficult with so many different stock lines
 with low levels of stock and the emergency demand for parts during a break down
 so statistical modelling and automation should be used to set stock levels
 to the investment capacity of the business.
